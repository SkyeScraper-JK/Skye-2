  # Temporarily disable RLS policies for development

  This migration temporarily disables RLS policies that are blocking project creation
  in the development environment. This should only be used for development and
  testing purposes.

  ## Changes
  1. Drop existing restrictive RLS policies on projects table
  2. Add permissive policies that allow authenticated users to perform operations
  3. Ensure units table policies work with the new project policies

  ## Security Note
  These policies are more permissive than production policies should be.
  In production, you should implement proper authentication and more restrictive policies.
